Difference between Thread Class & Runnable Interface

Thread: -> Class extending Thread class cannot extend other class
	  -> Enables tight coupling
	  -> Extended only if there is a need of overriding other methods of it


Runnable:	-> Class implementing Runnable can implement any other Interface
		-> Enables loose coupling
		-> Implemented only if there is a nedd of special run()


Demon threads:	-> Thread that is executed along with the main thread
			-> JVM starts executing demon thread along with main thread (concurrently)



-----------------------------------  Multi Threading ----------------------------------------------


Multi Threading:	-> Multi Threading is the ability of a program to run 2 or more threads concurrently, where each thread handles a different task at the same
				time.

SYNCHRONIZED:	-> When 1 thread is using the task method, synchronized keyword will create a lock so that no other thread can access that method.
		  	-> Which helps in sequential execution of threads
			-> Is helpful when We have multiple threads working on the same task class object i.e 1 task method is used by multiple threads 



isAlive() :	-> Determines if a thread is running or not

join():	-> It allows the thread to complete first before any other threads or statements. Disallowing parallel running.

setName():	-> Sets a name for the thread.	
getName():	-> Gets name

setPriority():	-> Sets priority for a thread.(1 is least, 10 is top)	
getPriority(): -> Gets priority

currentThread():	-> Defines the current thread
