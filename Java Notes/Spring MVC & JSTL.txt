JSP should always be used for view purpose only i.e frontend

Servlets should always be used to write the business logic, as JSP takes time to get converted into a Servlet


Question arises, why not use html to create frontend instead of JSP ?
-> As html pages are static pages. Pages created in JSP are dynamic pages


Difference between static and dynamic pages:
-> In Facebook every user can see the same settings tab, but their news feeds are different based on their watch history.
-> Here settings become static page and news feed becomes dynamic page.
